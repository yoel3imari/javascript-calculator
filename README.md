    <h2>I created a scientic calculator using javascript</h2>
    <p>
        This calculator has 3 main features:
        <ol>
            <li>It allows you to do simple maths</li>
            <li>It records the history of operations you did</li>
            <li>It gives you the ability of calculating complexe operations that include many functions</li>
            <li>It allows you to tap numbers and operant using your keyboard</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Rules to follow when using this calculator</h2>
    <p>
        To use this calculator properly, you need to follow these rules:
        <ol>
            <li>All functions (Ln, e, cos, sin, ...) should be used with brackets to wrap their parameters. Ex: ln(5) is corret, ln5 is not</li>
            <li>Before using Y<sup>x</sup> you should tap a single '(' , write the base then tap Y<sup>x</sup> or X<sup>2</sup> on the option section then write the power and close the brackets. Ex: (15+2)^(3) = </li>
            <li>Always make sure all brackets have an openning and a closing pair. Otherwise you will get a beautiful Error</li>
            <li>If you get "Error 2" that means the result is "Infinity". It happens for an instance when you try to calculate Ln(0) or division by 0</li>
        </ol>
